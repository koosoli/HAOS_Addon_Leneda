# DATA DISPLAY FIXED - Understanding Leneda's Historical Data

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The dashboard was trying to fetch "real-time" or "today's" data, but **Leneda only provides historical data from PREVIOUS days**. This is by design in Luxembourg's smart meter infrastructure.

### The Solution
Completely rewrote the data fetching logic to:
1. **Show yesterday's data** instead of today
2. **End all date ranges yesterday** (not "now")
3. **Display 15-minute intervals from yesterday**
4. **Calculate invoices for previous month** (complete data)

---

## 📊 How Leneda Data Works

### Data Availability Timeline
```
Today (Sep 30)    →  NO DATA YET
Yesterday (Sep 29) →  ✅ FULL DATA AVAILABLE (96 x 15-min intervals)
2 days ago (Sep 28) →  ✅ FULL DATA AVAILABLE
...and so on
```

### Why This Happens
- Smart meters upload data overnight
- Data processing takes time
- Quality checks and validation
- **Result:** Data appears 1 day later (this is normal!)

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

### Dashboard Cards
- **"Yesterday's Peak"** - Shows peak power from yesterday's 96 intervals
- **"Yesterday's Usage"** - Total kWh consumed yesterday
- **"Yesterday's Production"** - Solar production from yesterday

### Live Chart (Renamed)
- **Shows:** Yesterday's 15-minute interval data
- **96 data points** (24 hours × 4 intervals/hour)
- **Updates:** Once per day when new data arrives

### Historical Charts
- **Last 7 Days:** Daily totals ending yesterday
- **Last 30 Days:** Daily totals ending yesterday
- **Last 12 Months:** Monthly totals ending last month

### Invoice Calculator
- **Calculates:** Previous complete month
- **Example:** On Sep 30, calculates August 1-31
- **Why:** Complete data ensures accurate billing

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### JavaScript (app.js)
**Before:**
```javascript
const now = new Date();
fetch(`/api/metering-data?start_date=${now}...`); // ❌ No data!
```

**After:**
```javascript
const yesterday = new Date();
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
const yesterdayEnd = new Date(yesterday.setHours(23,59,59));
fetch(`/api/metering-data?start_date=${yesterday}&end_date=${yesterdayEnd}...`); // ✅ Data available!
```

### Key Functions Updated
1. `updateDashboardStats()` - Fetches yesterday's aggregated data
2. `updateLiveChart()` - Fetches yesterday's 15-min intervals
3. `updateChartData()` - Ensures end date = yesterday
4. `calculateInvoice()` - Uses previous complete month

## 🎨 Branding Updates

### New Logos
- **logo.svg** - Full branding with "Leneda Energy Dashboard" text
- **icon.svg** - Compact icon for addon store

### Design Elements
- Lightning bolt (energy symbol)
- Meter ring (smart meter reference)
- Data points (15-minute intervals)
- Blue-green gradient (Leneda colors)

---

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

### Info Banner Added
```
ℹ️ Data Availability: Leneda provides historical data from 
previous days (updated daily). Real-time data is not available.
```

### Better Labels
- "Today's Usage" → "Yesterday's Usage"
- "Current Consumption" → "Yesterday's Peak"
- "Right Now" → "Yesterday's Peak"

### Status Messages
- ✅ "Data refreshed successfully"
- ⚠️ "No data available for yesterday. Data appears 1 day later."
- ❌ "Failed to fetch data from Leneda API"

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

1. **Reload the addon repository** in Home Assistant
2. **Reinstall the addon** (if already installed)
3. **Configure your metering point** in addon settings
4. **Wait 5 minutes** for first data fetch
5. **View yesterday's data** in the dashboard!

### Expected Behavior
- Open addon → See yesterday's full day data
- Refresh → Updates with latest yesterday data
- Next day → Shows new "yesterday" (which is today's yesterday)

### Data Flow Example
```
September 30 (today):
  - Dashboard shows: September 29 data
  - 96 intervals: 00:00 to 23:45 on Sep 29
  - All aggregations end: Sep 29 23:59

October 1 (tomorrow):
  - Dashboard shows: September 30 data
  - Yesterday's data is now available!
```
