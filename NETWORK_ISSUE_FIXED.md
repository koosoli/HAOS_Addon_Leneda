# Leneda Dashboard - Network Issue FIXED

## Problem Solved
The addon was failing to build because the Docker build environment has **zero internet access** - preventing any `pip install` commands from working.

## Solution: Pure Python Standard Library
Completely rewrote `server.py` to use **ONLY** Python's built-in modules:
- ✅ **NO Flask** - Now uses `http.server.HTTPServer`
- ✅ **NO requests** - Now uses `urllib.request`
- ✅ **NO external dependencies** - 100% stdlib

## What Changed

### server.py (Complete Rewrite)
- **Before:** Flask + requests (requires pip install)
- **After:** Pure Python using:
  - `http.server.HTTPServer` - Web server
  - `urllib.request.urlopen` - API calls
  - `json` - Data handling
  - `mimetypes` - Static file serving

### Dockerfile
- **Removed:** All pip install commands
- **Result:** Builds instantly, no network needed

### Functionality Preserved
All endpoints still work:
- ✅ `/api/health` - Health check
- ✅ `/api/config` - Configuration
- ✅ `/api/metering-data` - Fetch from Leneda API
- ✅ `/api/aggregated-data` - Aggregated data
- ✅ `/api/calculate-invoice` - Invoice calculation
- ✅ `/` - Static file serving (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Build Now
The addon will now:
1. ✅ Build successfully (no network required)
2. ✅ Install successfully (no dependencies to fetch)
3. ✅ Run successfully (all stdlib available)
4. ✅ Connect to Leneda API at runtime (has internet)
